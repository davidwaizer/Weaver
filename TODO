This is a non-comprehensive list of features and ideas.

Look & Feel:
=============================

Manage Servers Overview:
	o Layers should be able to be on the same tier
	o Clicking on the layer name should allow you to rename
	o The server hover pane should include more information about the server instance
		- When it was started
		- AMI/Instance ID
		- Public/Private DNS




Functionality
=============================
Everything is missing at this point. Focusing on the UI first.

o Allow user to specify new actions for a particular server configuration
	- i.e. "Backup", "Rebuild indexes", "Add Slave Database"

o Validate finger prints of local SSH keys (right now it would fail when connecting)
